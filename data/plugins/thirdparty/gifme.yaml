  Superior gif responses. Giphy has gone downhill, so save your own library of
  image or video responses. Allows fallback behavior to giphy.com or Tenor, and
  can even be used as a drop-in replacement for your current giphy plugin.
  Optionally saves quotes from users for comedic effect or to be used as an FAQ
  bot!
